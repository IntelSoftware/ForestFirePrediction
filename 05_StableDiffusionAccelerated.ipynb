    "I use Stable Diffusion to synthesize aerial photos for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Real images that are free to download are time consuming to obtain.\n",
    "2) Real images that are easy to obtain via nice API's, are typically NOT free.\n",
    "3) Time constraints limit the number I am willing to download.\n",
    "4) Distribution of real data to attendees is problematic from a usage license stand point.\n",
    "5) Synthetic images can be generated in bulk easily\n",
    "6) There is a key learning I want to share with attendees regarding optimizing Stable Diffusion using the Intel(R) Extensions for PyTorch*\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "Stable Diffusion is a technique that uses a special kind of diffusion model developed by the CompVis group at LMU Munich. This model helps improve images by reducing noise. It has three main parts: a variational autoencoder (VAE) that compresses the image, a U-Net that removes noise, and an optional text encoder. The VAE makes the image smaller and more meaningful, while the U-Net removes noise. The process involves applying Gaussian noise and then removing it. The VAE decoder completes the process by turning the compressed image back into a clear picture.\n",

    "In this project we downloaded 10 images from US government sources for NAIP/DOQQ images with two classes in mind - photos which will be marred in the future by forest fires, and photos which will remain un-phased by forest fires in the next two years (referencing 2016/2017).\n",
