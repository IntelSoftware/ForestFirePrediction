# Forest Fire Prediction

### Learning Objectives:

- Apply Intel Extension for PyTorch to convert model and data to xpu 
- Apply fine tuning to satellite images to predict fire fires 2 years in advance
- Generate syntheic satellite images using Stable Diffusion
- Optimize a four stage Stable Diffusion pipeline using Intel(r) Extensions for PyTorch*

# FAQ

- Q: What is the minimum acreage MODIS considers a burn area? A: Not spcified
- Q: Define a burn area - Where a fire starts is not the same than how big the fire got.  Maybe  many small fires contribued to a burn area - What is the MODIS definition of burn area? A: Not specified
- Q: Have you considered instead of using USDA, to feed the model with land use map, orientation map, elevation map and slope map or other sources even tabular sources? A: a multi modal approach such as this was considered but for sake of time and complexity I gave up on the effort.
- Q: How will the current CA and NV fire right now would influence the relevance of your notebook? A: the MODIS dataset does not yest have information about current burn areas. However a model trained on images from surrounding areas and times woudl likely be predictive if pre-fire iamges had been fed to a well trained model
- Q: What is the impact of forest fires, how many lives and how much money the fires cost in CA? A: this is addressed in the [01_Overview_Finetuning.ipynb](01_Overview_Finetuning.ipynb) module.
- Q: What hardware does this workshop give us access to? A: You will be doing experiments on the Intel(r) 4th Generation Scalable Xeon processors equipped with Intel(r) Data Center GPU max series accelerators (xpu)
